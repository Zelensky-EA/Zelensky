# AP Biology Student Hub

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

## Live Navigator data

The site includes a saved snapshot of the supplied Navigator sheet, including the HOME After Class and Teacher Note fields used by the current navigator.

The published student calendar CSV is configured as the default live source. `VITE_NAVIGATOR_CSV_URL` can override it when building. The expected column order is Week, Day, Date, CED Topic, Topic Title / I Can, Class, Campbell, BIOZONE, HOME After Class, AP Target, and Teacher Note.

For GitHub Pages, add the URL as a repository variable under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**. The included workflow deploys the site whenever `main` is updated.
